ANSWERS:

Q1:
            1. You are required to add one more command: “leave_group <group name>” – the client will be
            removed from the specified group. If the group becomes empty it should be removed (i.e. it will be
            valid to use <group name> again).
            a. Which changes are required in the client side in order to support the new command?
            b. Which changes are required in the server side in order to support the new command?


Q2:

            2. Why do we prefer TCP over UDP in this exercise?


Q3:
            Give two examples for applications that use UDP. Why UDP is preferred for them?

Q4:


        4. In this exercise, in case of a server crash all the data is lost (we say that the server is a single
        point of failure). Describe high level design for a system that is able to recover from failures (we
        allow ​ some​ of the data to be lost).
